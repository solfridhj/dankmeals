                    Students fresh out of the comfort of momâ€™s cooking are often neglecting making homemade meals for themselves. 
                    With a whole new world to explore on campus, learning new activities and partying hard at the clubs, students often find little time to explore the kitchen. 
                    As eating out can be financially problematic every student should learn to cook for themselves, and others. 
                    Here at DankMeals we live to make your life as a student as easy as possible. 
                    Here you can find cheap, fast and tasty recipes made for students, by students.
