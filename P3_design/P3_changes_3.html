            <p>
                Two of our groupmembers dropped out of the course near the end of the project, so 
                many changes in work divisions were made (they did unfortunately not complete any of their original tasks). Due to time constraints, some changes to the design/functionality
                was made. We did not include mockups for smaller screens in the P2 documents, so these design choices were made while creating the webpage.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to all html files:</strong> The font was changed from Rubicon to Verdana, as we though this was a more visually pleasing font.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to index.html:</strong> Changed from Meal of the Day to Suggested Meal as headline (explained in meal_of_day.js change section)
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to suggestions.html:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to party.html/everyday.html/relax.html:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipe.html:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                    <strong>Changes to meal_of_day.js:</strong> Changed from meal_of_day.js, to generating a random meal and updating homepage.
                    The original plan became too complicated, and we desided that this random functionallity could give the user more suggestions for
                    recipes every time they entered page, not just once every day. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to search.html:</strong> Added so the user knows they typed something in, but as we have no backend, they recieve an error message. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to try_your_luck_meal.html:</strong> Many design changes to make it more visually appealing.
