                <h2>Changes that were made</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Two of our groupmembers dropped out of the course near the end of the project, so 
                many changes in work divisions were made (they unfortunately did not complete any of their original tasks). Due to time constraints, some changes to the design/functionality
                was made. We did not include mockups for smaller screens in the P2 documents, so these design choices were made while creating the webpage.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to all html files:</strong> The font was changed from Rubicon to Helvetica, as we felt this gave a more modern look. 
                Additionally, text alignment was changed from left to centered on all pages (except for contact.html) as we agreed this was a better look for the site.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to index.html:</strong> Changed from Meal of the Day to Suggested Meal as headline (explained in meal_of_day.js change section).
                The image of the suggested meal was changed from a specific size of 475x300px to be 80% of body width so that it would look better on smaller screens. 
                The internal link to the recipe's page was changed from only being on the title of the meal to include the description of the meal as well as the image, 
                making it even easier to navigate to the recipe page.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to about.html:</strong> Changed this page to only share some background, some of
                our goals and market our site as we did not see it necessary to include as much content on this page as initially planned. We also included a picture of ourselves, the dankest developers in town.

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.html:</strong> Included a link to our meal suggestion page. 
                Kept this page's text alignment to the left when all other pages were changed because it looked better.
                Changed from giving users a "submitted" alert when pressing the submit button to link to the submitted.html page instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to suggestions.html and submitted.html:</strong> Changed the ability to add more ingredient fields as this functionality proved too difficult to implement. 
                Added a maximum of 6 ingredient fields to fill when submitting as this was deemed sufficient in order to suggest recipes. Changed the layout of text and textfields to be centered rather than on the left side of the page. 
                Included link to submitted.html upon pressing the submit button.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to submitted.html:</strong> Added a html page that aknowledges the user's submissions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipe sub-pages (party.html/everyday.html/chill.html):</strong> The design is kept quite similar to the original design plan, but the on hover behaviour has changed a bit. Instead of altering the text color 
                from black to blue, we decided it was better to add shadows to the ingredients elements. We have also removed the black borders the ingredients elements were supposed to have, so that the grey shadow given on hover
                gives the user a clear understanding of that the ingredient item is being selected. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipe.html:</strong> The layout of this page is not changed much from the original design plan, but the styling of the different category elements have changes a bit. 
                The categories relax, everyday and party, now have a headline, an image, and some white padding and margins. This makes the category items stand 
                out more from the background, in our opinion. Also the link to the suggeston form was given a little more styling than what was proposed in P2. 
                The link was given more focus, as it was made bigger, and was given the same blue color as the navigation bar to give a more complete design.  
            </p>

            <p>
                    <strong>Changes to meal_of_day.js:</strong> Changed from meal_of_day.js, to generating a random meal and updating homepage.
                    The original plan became too complicated, and we decided that this random functionality could give the user more suggestions for
                    recipes every time they entered page, not just once every day. This way the function would still fulfill our goal of inspiring students to try new meals. An additional challenge was to make this now random function loop through each and every recipe before resetting the pool of recipes to choose from.
                    As a result, this functionality was scrapped and the same recipe could now be suggested twice in a row. However, this is a problem we would like to solve and implement correctly as we initially wanted to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to search.html:</strong> Added so the user knows they typed something in, but as we have no backend, they recieve an error message. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to try_your_luck_meal.html:</strong> Many design changes have been executed to make it more visually appealing. Also the original plan to 
                have both drink and meal generator at the same page, have been altered. We decided to only include a meal generator, and have focused on the design of 
                the try-your-luck meal generator. The red big button is still kept with some change in opacity when hovering, as it is easy to notice, and we think it is a fun element. The output fields that are to hold
                the ingredients, have been changed a lot. They have been made blue, rounded in the edges, and bigger, to give the input fields more focus. Also an explanation
                text has been added under the ingredients fields to inform the user what is going on. The explanation text will inform that a meal is being generated when the javascript is looping through the 
                ingredients, and will inform when the meal is generated. This was done because we got feedback from a user (before the testing phase) that the try-your-luck meal generator 
                was a bit confusing, and that he did not understand what was going on. After adding the explanation text the user gave feedback that it was easier to understand that a meal was actually
                being generated.
