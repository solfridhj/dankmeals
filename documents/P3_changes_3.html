            </header>
            <p>
                Two of our groupmembers dropped out of the course near the end of the project, so 
                many changes in work divisions were made (they unfortunately did not complete any of their original tasks). Due to time constraints, some changes to the design/functionality
                was made. We did not include mockups for smaller screens in the P2 documents, so these design choices were made while creating the webpage.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to all html files:</strong> The font was changed from Rubicon to Helvetica, as we felt this gave a more modern look. 
                Additionally, text alignment was changed from left to centered on all pages (except for contact.html and the recipe pages) as we agreed this was a better look for the site.
            </p>

            

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to index.html:</strong> Changed from Meal of the Day to Suggested Meal as headline (explained in meal_of_day.js change section).
                The image of the suggested meal was changed from a specific size of 475x300px to be 80% of body width so that it would look better on smaller screens. 
                The internal link to the recipe's page was changed from only being on the title of the meal to include the description of the meal as well as the image, 
                making it even easier to navigate to the recipe page.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to about.html:</strong> Changed this page to only share some background, some of
                our goals and market our site as we did not see it necessary to include as much content on this page as initially 
                planned. We also included a picture of ourselves. As students are busy, we dont see it as very
                 likely that they will spend a lot time reading a long "about us" section. So our change is still inline with our goal of 
                 getting students to create a variety of meals. 

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.html:</strong> We included a link to our meal suggestion page. This was done to make it easier to find this page, as it 
                previously only was at the bottom of the "Recipe landingpage". We hope this change will make it easier to find, so that users can actively contribute
                with recipes. This will again contribute to the goal of students being more interested in creating different meals. 
                We kept this page's text alignment to the left when all other pages were changed as we thought it looked better.
                Previously the users were given a "submitted" alert when pressing the submit button, but we changed to link to the submitted.html page as we thought 
                this was a more clear way of giving the information to the user. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to suggestions.html:</strong> The ability to add more ingredient fields proved too difficult to implement, so we removed this feature.
                We added a maximum of 6 ingredient fields to fill when submitting as this was deemed sufficient in order to suggest recipes. We changed the layout of 
                text and textfields to be centered rather than on the left side of the page, due to aesthetic reasons. 
                When pressing the submit button, the user is directed to submitted.html (not alert, for same reason as above). 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to submitted.html:</strong> Added a html page that aknowledges the user's submissions, to make it clear that the form was submitted (of course, its not really submitted, but
                for test purposes).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipe sub-pages (party.html/everyday.html/chill.html):</strong> The design is kept quite similar to the original design plan, but the on hover behaviour has changed a bit. Instead of altering the text color 
                from black to blue, we decided it was better to add shadows to the ingredients elements. We have also removed the black borders the ingredients elements were supposed to have, so that the grey shadow given on hover
                gives the user a clear understanding of that the ingredient item is being selected. Also we changed the sub-page originally called relax to chill, since we thought this was a more 
                appropriate name for this category. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipe.html:</strong> The layout of this page is not changed much from the original design plan, but the styling of the different category elements have changes a bit. 
                The categories relax, everyday and party, now have a headline, an image, and some white padding and margins. This makes the category items stand 
                out more from the background, in our opinion. Also the link to the suggeston form was given a little more styling than what was proposed in P2. 
                The link was given more focus, as it was made bigger, and was given the same blue color as the navigation bar to give a more complete design.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to recipes (focaccia.html, tapas.html etc.):</strong>
                We added lines between each ingredient inside the ingredient box, making it easier to get an overview of all ingredients. The list bullet points were removed as we
                though the lines gave a clear separation.
                Changed the width of images from 500px to 600px. We also made the "Ingredients" text all capital letters, and placed it inside the white
                box for the ingredients. The text was centered within the box. The white box is now the same height as the right section of the page (stops where image stops).
                All of these changes were to improve the design. As we feel that students have high
                standards for the webpages they use, we felt it was important to make this design as good as possible. This design change thus helps achieve our goal by making
                out webpage more attractive. 

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to meal_of_day.js:</strong> We changed from generating a meal of the day (i.e. a new one once per day), to generating a random meal and updating homepage each time the homepage is updated.
                The original plan became too complicated, and we decided that this random functionality could give the user more suggestions for
                recipes every time they entered page, not just once every day. This way the function would still fulfill our goal of inspiring students to try new meals.
                We originally wanted to make this now random function loop through each and every recipe before resetting the pool of recipes to choose from. This was more difficult than we though, and 
                the recipe chosen is simply a random meal from the array containing all the meals. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to navbar.js:</strong> We eemoved the black line between our logo and the rest of the navbar to make the design more modern looking. 
                The dropdown menu when hovering recipes was made less wide as to not overshadow unnecessarily amounts of the top of webpage. Made the current hover on the dropdown menu darker to provide a larger contrast between what is selected and what is not, in order to improve navigation (and make 
                the webpage more accessible to students with bad vision).
                In addition, we kept the default style for the search bar rather than implementing our design in the mockup. This was done as the search function is not functional, and including an image of a magnifying glass in the search field proved too difficult. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to search.html:</strong> Added a search confirmation page so the user knows their search was recieved, but as we have not implemented this feature, they get an error message. This is to make the webpage as clear as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to try_your_luck_meal.html:</strong> Many design changes have been executed to make it more visually appealing. Also the original plan to 
                have both drink and meal generator at the same page, have been altered. We decided to only include a meal generator, and have focused on the design of 
                the try-your-luck meal generator. The red big button is still kept with some change in opacity when hovering, as it is easy to notice, and we think it is a fun element. The output fields that are to hold
                the ingredients, have been changed a lot. They have been made blue, rounded in the edges, and bigger, to give the input fields more focus. Also an explanation
                text has been added under the ingredients fields to inform the user what is going on. The explanation text will inform that a meal is being generated when the javascript is looping through the 
                ingredients, and will inform when the meal is generated. This was done because we got feedback from a user (before the testing phase) that the try-your-luck meal generator 
                was a bit confusing, and that he did not understand what was going on. After adding the explanation text the user gave feedback that it was easier to understand that a meal was actually
                being generated. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>Favicon:</strong> We decided to include a favicon, as this made the site look more professional.</p>

            <p>The try_your_luck_drink.html was removed from the webpage, as we had to prioritize other things when losing two group members. We decided to focus more on 
                the try_your_luck_meal.html, which has the same functionality as the drink version would have.
